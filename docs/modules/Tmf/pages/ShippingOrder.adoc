== Description
A Shipping Order is a document used by a business to specify what items are to be transferred from a storage location or warehouse to which person and to which new location. A Shipping Order can typically be sent along with a shipment of goods so that the person receiving them can verify that the document correctly reflects the items that they actually received.
